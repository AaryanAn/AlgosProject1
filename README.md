## Project Overview
AlgosProject1 is a comprehensive exploration of algorithmic techniques, focusing on greedy algorithms and dynamic programming. The project involves the implementation, analysis, and testing of algorithms, complemented by performance comparisons and visualizations.

## Features
- Implementation of algorithms for greedy and dynamic programming techniques.
- Comparative analysis of algorithm performance.
- Visualization of runtime performance.
- Comprehensive documentation of methods and results.
- Rigorous testing to ensure algorithm correctness.

## Contributions
This project highlights several key contributions:
1. **Algorithm Implementations:**
   - Developed `program1.py` and `program2.py` to implement algorithms for specific problems using greedy and dynamic programming approaches.

2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Conducted a performance study, using `comparative.ipynb` and `comparative_study.py` to analyze and compare the efficiency of different approaches.

3. **Testing:**
   - Designed test cases in `test_p1.py` to validate the correctness of the implemented algorithms under various scenarios.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Authored the detailed report, "Programming Project Greedy & DP-2.pdf," explaining methodologies, results, and insights gained during the project.

5. **Performance Visualization:**
   - Generated runtime visualizations (`program1_runtime.png` and `program2_runtime.png`) to provide a clear understanding of algorithm efficiency.

6. **Auxiliary Implementations:**
   - Created additional scripts (`bishoy1.py` and `bishoy2.py`) to support the primary implementations or explore alternative methods.
